# Why Role Definitions Matter

* Clarity for the individual in the role
* Guidance for those interacting with someone in a role
* Identify an entry point into DevRel for others
* DevRel has matured. There is now specialization.
* Roles within a team represent the implementation of a strategy

# 📝 A Note on Strategy

  ## Start with the Strategy
